# Advisory only: always exits 0. Prints a warning at PR-review time if
# the count of `malloc`/`realloc`/`calloc` mentions in c/zlib_ffi.c

# "Allocation site audit (c/zlib_ffi.c)". Drift does not mean "broken";
# it means "re-run the audit and update the table".

# This is a trip wire, not a fence. It is not wired into CI — the goal
# is to make accidental new alloc sites visible in a `git diff`, not to
# reject them automatically.
